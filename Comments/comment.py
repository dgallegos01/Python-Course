# using comments for multiple things
# comments are used to explain what the code is doing.
# we use 'hashtag' to block out anything from the actual code
# example:
print("sky is blue") # this is a print statement that will print 'Sky is blue' in the terminal
# *use comments to explain advanced coding methods instead of simple print statements
# *try not to be too repetative
# *use comments as reminders for what parts of code do like functions
