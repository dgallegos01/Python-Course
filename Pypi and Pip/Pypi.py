# Pypi is a place where you can find and download packages from developers in the Python community
# You can search for these packages at "pypi.org"
# keep in mind some modules may have bugs or glitches because they are still in development
# for this example we will download a package that will give us access to information on a website like Yelp.com
# go on pypi.org and search for 'openpyxl'
# when you click on the file you will get a 'pip' install command
# on the terminal, copy and paste that command to the terminal
# Python will install the package
# *'pip' is a Python command that lets us install and uninstall packages
# packages will show up in: C:\Python38\Lib\site-packages
# packages could have sub-packages
# now we will work on a project with our downloaded package
# go to the 'package' folder and find the 'excel' file

# THIS IS THE END OF THE PYTHON COURSE!
