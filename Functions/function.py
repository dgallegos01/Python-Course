# functions are a way to separate our code, organize it and make it callable
# they are essentially containers for peices of code
# they are also reuseable
# example:
def greet_user(): # we have defined a function 'greet_user'
    print('Hi there!')
    print('Welcome aboard')
# *functions should always be lowercased, seperated with underscores if needed, and should have very distict names to their purpose
print('Start')
greet_user() # here we are calling the function. make sure to have open/close parenthesis to declare the funtion
print("Finish")
# *always create your fuctions first before you call them. try keeping your functions at the vary top of your code so there is no confusion
